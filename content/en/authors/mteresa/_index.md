I am a data analyst with experience in ecology and marketing, I currently work in Kantar where I do software development with R.

I also enjoy teaching, I teach statistic courses to master students in Data Science and to bachelors in Mathematics and Actuarial Sciences at ITAM. Lastly, I love R, I am co-organizer of R-Ladies CDMX and I regularly give short courses in R.
